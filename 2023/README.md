Welcome to the Database Technologies course API assignemnt for 2023! This course is offered by the Faculty of Informatics and Information Technologies at the Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava, and is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the principles and practices of database design and implementation.

In this assignment, you will be designing and implementing a RESTful web service for managing library resources such as books, publications, and rentals. You will be provided with a database model and API specification created using OpenAPI, which you will use to create an API that meets the requirements outlined in the specification.

To get started with the assignment, you can import the provided OpenAPI specification file into your favorite API development tool or framework, such as [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) or Postman. Once you have imported the specification, you can use it to create your own implementation of the Library API that meets the requirements outlined in the specification.

We hope that you find the assignment to be both challenging and rewarding, and that it provides you with a valuable opportunity to learn and grow as a database technologies professional.
